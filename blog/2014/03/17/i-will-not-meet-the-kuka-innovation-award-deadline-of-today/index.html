<div class="entry-content"><p>Even if it is quite difficult to write, I have to face the reality. I have nothing to send today to the KUKA Innovation Award team. Failure is bitter, and this one really really bitter. I have to keep in mind that failing is the mandatory way to improve himself. So let&rsquo;s sum what happened and what has been done up to now.</p>

<p>Note: the first links refer to my previous blog.</p>

<h3>May &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>I have <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/first-steps-into-robotics-with-webots-rookie-style/">discovered robotics</a> thanks to the free trial of <a href="http://www.cyberbotics.com/overview">Webots</a>, the simulator from Cyberbotics. It was something that I had in mind for months and starting with a simulator has been really convenient.</p>

<p>After this first trial, I looked for a robotics platform to play with a real robot. I had the <a href="http://www.irobot.com/us/learn/home/roomba.aspx">Roomba</a> in mind for a while, the vacuum cleaning robot. This robot is broadly available and I found a lot of doc to hack it.</p>

<p>I finally discovered the <a href="http://www.kuka-labs.com/en/network/innovationaward/">KUKA Innovation Award</a>, and the <a href="http://www.youbot-store.com/youbot-store/youbots/youbots/">youBot robotic platform</a>. The price tag of this robot was too high for me. The solution was to apply to the sponsor track, in which a youBot would be rent for free. I just had to find a project idea.</p>

<h3>June &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>I have been deeply moved by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kismet_(robot)">robot Kismet</a>, the affective computing and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93robot_interaction">human robot interaction (HRI)</a> in general. My project idea was to develop HRI around an robotic platform that is really far from a human shape, the youBot in this case. Most of the HRI initiatives are based on humanoids and try to mimic human behaviors. This is a very challenging target and unreachable for me. My personal challenge was to deliver something to interact with any robot and develop behaviors that could be understood by anyone.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s call it a well-design interface for a robotic system.</p>

<p>I also wanted to use Android based devices as sensors. Robotics sensors are very expensive and a simple smart phone is bundled with a lot of interesting features.</p>

<p>The deadline for the <a href="https://github.com/Arn-O/kuk-A-droid/raw/master/docs/pdf/kuka_innovation_in_mobile_manipulation_award_application_form_(initial).pdf">initial submission</a> was the 14th. The form has been sent on time.</p>

<p>I learnt Java the year before. I spent the end of the month to learn how to code on Android platforms. There is no console, so the tricky part at that time was to master the GUI.</p>

<p>After a couple of experiments, I moved my <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/my-development-environment-moved-to-ubuntu-big-change/">coding environment to Ubuntu</a> (the on-boarded PC of the youBot is based on Ubuntu), and never switched back to Windows since then.</p>

<h3>July &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>I had a specific goal in mind when learning Java on Android: build an program that could speak to a script in Python on the PC through the USB interface and the Android Accessory protocol. I have finally mastered this pretty well. I am very proud of this <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/python-android-accessory-usb-proof-of-concept/">detail blog post</a> published after this result.</p>

<p>During this month, I also learnt a lot about ROS and Gazebo. This simulator is not very easy to use. Do not get me wrong, I like it very much. You have to be careful of <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/how-to-start-and-stop-gazebo-properly/">how to start and stop it</a>. My goal was to convert an outdated <a href="https://github.com/Arn-O/youbot_ros_tools">youBot description to the last standard</a>. Even with <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/first-picture-of-simulated-youbot-smile/">some success</a>, I was really far for a workable release.</p>

<h3>August &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>This month is very special, since I have started to <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/github-survival-kit-for-linux-social-coding/">keep all my sources on GitHub</a>. I instantly became a big fan of the service.</p>

<p>I have fine tuned Gazebo by <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/using-nvidia-chip-driver-thinkpad-laptop-running-ubuntu-backlight/">activating the NVIDIA graphic cards of my laptop from Ubuntu</a>. Tricky not to say time consuming, as usual for a mix of open source and close source software.</p>

<p>I have delivered my first ROS program, a Python teleop program for my <a href="https://github.com/Arn-O/youbot_ros_tools">youBot package</a>. To do that, I had to design how to interact with a Python script from a command line interface, a work that I still use a lot.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I faced strong issues with the inertia and at that time, I did not have the skills to handle it.</p>

<h3>September &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>I was already really really late for the KUKA award. I was not mastering the robot at all. So I have defined a new planning to have something to show for the coming form submission.</p>

<p>I tried to work on the <a href="http://zombiebrainzjuice.fr/first-result-youbot-workspace-exploration/">workspace of the youBot</a>. I realized after that this work was quite amateurish, as I learnt it during the CS223A course. Anyway, this pure experimental work made the theoretical knowledge from the robotics course even more beneficial. And I have learnt <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">mathplotlib</a>.</p>

<p>During this month, I have open the GitHub repo for my project, dubbed <a href="https://github.com/Arn-O/kuk-A-droid">&ldquo;kuk-A-droid&rdquo;</a>. The README has been well written and a couple of code stubs have been pushed to the repo.</p>

<p>The integration between ROS and Gazebo became erratic, and it has been painful, not to say a nightmare, to have a working simulation of the youBot. Gazebo was under heavy development and I considered at that time that using an instable version for the project was a mistake.</p>

<h3>October &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>In October, the integration between ROS and Gazebo was so bad, that I gave up the simulator for a <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/blog/2013/10/13/major-change-of-design-i-drop-the-dynamics/">pure kinematics approach</a>. I had this idea after a couple of experiment, and with better robotics knowledge, I could have done it before.</p>

<p>A lot of documentation has been written on the kuk-A-droid repository during this period (in the wiki). The main one is the design of a <a href="https://github.com/Arn-O/kuk-A-droid/wiki/Social-expectations-from-the-KUKA-youBot">social behaviors for a robot like the youBot</a>. It was after all the core topic of my project, and it has been a real pleasure to write this.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Arn-O/kuk-A-droid/raw/master/docs/pdf/kuka_innovation_in_mobile_manipulation_award_application_form_(final).pdf">final application form</a> has been submitted on time. This one was clearly far better than the previous one. Unfortunately, the progress was quite poor and I had nothing to show.</p>

<p>Thanks to a blog post around the USB hack, I have found a contributor to the kuk-A-droid project. A <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/blog/2013/10/23/call-for-contribution-robotics-project-on-the-air/">call for contribution</a> has been issued for general purpose and <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/blog/2013/10/28/call-for-contribution-3d-graphics-animator/">call for a graphics animator</a>. I have been inspired by the fantastic <a href="http://www.openworm.org/">OpenWorm project</a>. This is how science should be done nowadays. I really wanted to expand the team.</p>

<p>Last event for October, I have started a <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/">new blog</a> dedicated to my work and learning in robotics. This last one is based on octopress and hosted on GitHub pages.</p>

<h3>November &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>My call for contribution for a graphics animator has been successful and the one that joined the team produced <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/kuk-A-droid/demo/">this demo in threejs</a>. There are many similarities between animation and robotics and even more with robotics simulation. He did a fantastic work on the meshes. The mecanum wheels movement are very realistic.</p>

<p>KUKA contacted me for a new page on their website, listing all projects based on the youBot. The <a href="http://www.youbot-store.com/youbot-developers/projects/kuk-a-droid-project?c=62">kuk-A-droid project has been posted</a> on it. This was a first achievement for the team.</p>

<p>This month, the integration between ROS and Gazebo has been fixed. Anyway, my new approach was to control the full trajectory, and to do that, I have <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/blog/2013/11/15/sequence-editor-upgraded-to-handle-several-joints/">developed a sequence editor</a> that generates smooth joint position curves. I got inspired by the animation world. I learnt afterwards that it was a good method for defining trajectories.</p>

<p>But the real event of this month is that <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/blog/2013/11/27/no-news-from-the-kuka-award/">after one month and an half without feedback</a> from KUKA and the opportunity to be sponsored, I more or less gave up the award. Not an easy decision as you can imagine.</p>

<h3>December &lsquo;13</h3>

<p>After this decision, I have defined a <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/blog/2013/12/08/courses-and-projects-program-for-the-coming-months/">courses and projects plan for the next year</a>. I missed a lot of basic robotics knowledge during the project, so this plan aimed at giving me the background for most of robotics topics (well, I am quite late on this now).</p>

<p>During this month, I have started the CS223A Introduction to robotics from Stanford Engineering Everywhere. I learnt a lot, it was clearly a required starting point.</p>

<p>In the last day of the year, I have <a href="http://arn-o.github.io/blog/2013/12/31/the-kuka-innovation-award-is-not-canceled/">discovered by luck on GitHub</a> that the Award was still on-going. Without news from KUKA, it was clear that I was no longer on race.</p>

<h3>January 2014</h3>

<p>The CS223A was quite time consuming and I decided to focus as much as possible on it. I had to master again matrix geometry and derivatives. No code during this course, so I took the opportunity to learn LaTeX.</p>

<p>The 22nd of January I finally received a mail from the KUKA innovation team. I have asked if they could rent me a youBot, but unfortunately they couldn&rsquo;t. I was really pleased to be in the loop. That was nevertheless not clear if I still had an opportunity to propose something (considering that the results are expected on an hardware platform).</p>

<p>The deadline for the final submission was the 17th of March.</p>

<h3>February 2014</h3>

<p>I focused on the CS223A and a couple of side topics.</p>

<h3>March 2014</h3>

<p>I have finished all the lectures and homeworks of the CS223A. As of writing, I still need to code them in LaTeX.</p>

<p>The 17th of March is today I will not send anything the KUKA innovation team.</p>

<p>Note: this blog post has been published almost one month after the deadline (but started the very day).</p>
